      <span class="news-article__date font-title">September 25, 2018</span>
      <div class="news-article__body"><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for all your support and patience over the last few months. We’re really happy to share with you Absolver Downfall expansion! Please find all the details in the patch note below.</p>

<p><iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F8yJ6MU2n6U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>We’re already working on a patch addressing some low reproduction bugs introduced with the new content. <br />
If you encounter any issue, please join us by email at support_pc@sloclap.com or support_ps4@sloclap.com! We’ll do our best to add more fixes to the incoming debug patch.</p>

<h1>New Content</h1>

<h2>Downfall <span class="caps">PVE</span> mode</h2>

<p>Battle deep in the mines of Adal as a solo warrior or in online cooperative play, collecting Gleam from Prospects infected by Arcell, an Etheran bent on breaking the Fold&#8217;s containment.. The more Gleam you capture, the more powerful you become in your struggle to defeat the Corrupted, and even Arcell himself. Each run through the Mines and Temples is a unique path through a variety of challenges and situations, facing upgraded enemies, and three epic boss fights. </p>

<p>This mode is available in the Combat Trials menu to all players that reached the Absolver rank. Collecting Gleam in Downfall runs will allow you to unlock new items in the Essence Shop, as well as the Faejin Combat Style.</p>

<h2>Faejin Combat Style</h2>

<p>Inspired by Bruce Lee’s Jeet Kune Do, the Faejin Combat Style blends defense and offense with percussive strikes and fluid power. The new approach is a complex style for experienced Absolvers, featuring different defensive abilities that depend on both input and stances. Faejin has 26 attacks for bare hands and wargloves, alongside 15 sword attacks.</p>

<p>This Combat Style will be unlockable in Downfall <span class="caps">PVE</span> mode.</p>

<h2>New Powers</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Sharp Impact</strong> &#8211; Bare-hands deal cut damage during 20s</li>
	<li><strong>Unbreakable</strong> &#8211; A protective barrier coats your body during 5s. Protection level is increased, and enemy attacks don’t stun or interrupt your own attacks. All weapons hitting the barrier break on impact</li>
	<li><strong>Snatcher</strong> &#8211; A short burst of Tension released from the Shards stuns briefly and disarms your opponent, pulling their weapon towards you</li>
	<li><strong>Shadow Avoid</strong> &#8211; Enter in resonance with your Tension Shards and avoid all incoming attacks for a short duration. Enemies hitting your Shadow will be slowed down for 2s</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be able to buy these new powers in the Essence Shop once your Gleam Level is high enough.</p>

<h2>Schools</h2>

<p>Absolvers who have reached the Disciple rank in a school (or who are Mentors of their own) can participate in School Challenges, by equipping all their School Content before heading to 1v1 Combat Trials. All wins representing one’s school count in the School challenges, with individual and collective performances of the schools bringing rewards every three weeks, at the end of the season.</p>

<p>For the occasion, the overall UI of the School system was revisited and we hope you’ll like it!</p>
