      <div class="news-article__body"><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>A lot of people in the community have been wondering what’s next for Absolver. Since the release of Downfall a month ago, we’ve been working on the post Downfall patches, to improve stability and fix issues, so here is some more information on the main things we’re currently working on! </p>

<p>Regarding the 1.27 patch, it will be debug only and is still being worked on for this week, we apologize for the delay.</p>

<p>If you encounter any bug, please send us videos with a short description at support_pc@sloclap.com or support_ps4@sloclap.com, it will be really helpful for us.</p>

<p>All the best, <br />
Sloclap team </p>

<h1>Updates and Improvements</h1>

<p>Thanks to our dedicated community, it has come to our attention that the Downfall update has introduced new combat behaviours that were not intended nor spotted in the test environment. To put it bluntly: a lot of veterans are saying the game is broken. <br />
We have investigated and identified a couple of Core Combat bugs impacting balance, so the current balance of the game does not reflect the Design intentions.<br />
Unfortunately, our Programmers have to focus on the Xbox version, which has been more complex than expected. We need to release it as soon as possible, which is why some gameplay debugging is taking longer than usual.</p>

<p>As soon as we have some bandwidth (in a couple of weeks), we will take a deep look into these issues and update the community.  </p>

<h1>Xbox</h1>

<p>Developers from all poles (Programming, Art, UI etc.) are focusing on the Xbox version right now: it requires a lot of specific work to make sure the version runs flawlessly on this platform.  We are unfortunately not yet able to provide a precise date for the Xbox launch right now, but we are happy to confirm that the Xbox version will have its first certification tests by the Microsoft team in a couple of weeks!</p>

<h1>Winter event</h1>

<p>There will be no Halloween event this year, but the Art Team is currently working on a winter event that will include the following content:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Several snowy 1v1 maps that will replace their usual counterparts</li>
	<li>Brand new cold regions themed full Sets</li><br />
</ul></p>
