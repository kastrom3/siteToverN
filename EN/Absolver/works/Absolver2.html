			<p><b>This is a text version of Absolver 2 concept, it exists simply because I do not think I will have time to make a video, so I will publish it like this for now, and then I will make a video.</b></p>
			<p>Before I start breaking down the concept, I would like to clarify a couple of things.</p>
			<p>Firstly, although the concept is detailed, it will still have to be finalized and reworked, because I worked alone and I am not a professional, I am an ordinary fan who just understands the lore.</p>
			<p>And yes, there will be a lot of lore here, after all, this is my main activity.</p>
			<p>And thirdly, before reading this concept, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the previous part of <a href="https://youtu.be/MBlK5RCUfs4" target="_blank">Absolvered ideas</a>, where I talk about the concept of updated AI for NPCs, which will also be used here. <i>(there are English subtitles)</i></p>
			<p><i>(Also, such text is my comments, and when you click on <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Artboock/img464.jpg" class="js-img-viewer" data-caption="Пример">the underlined text</a>, an image appears (to close, just click on the image))</i></p>

		<img id="sprt" src="">
		<h2>Main idea</h2>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>I decided that the best choice would be to make a game that is both a remake and a new part. That is, it needs to be the same Absolver, but at the same time it is different from it, so that it would not be a simple remake and it would be interesting to play it even for those who have already played this game.</p>
			The time span in which the game can take place is quite narrowed down:
				<ul>
					<li>It will not work to take the moment before the Fall and in general before the appearance of Absolver, because it will be a completely different game.</li>
					<li>Also, I don't think that going to the future would be a good choice, because the past was normally non disclosed, as well as, in principle, Ilentia.</li>
					<li>Therefore, I decided to stop at a moment not long before Risryn's betrayal, in this way it would be possible to better reveal the characters already known to us.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Structurally, I decided to stick with just taking Absolver and upscaling it. That is, the game is divided into 4 conditional arches with 3 locations + training. Each arc adds locations in 1v1, and also has 1 team PVP mode and 1 team PVE mode that opens after completing part of the story.True, I made it so that they are part of the plot, and not an offshoot of it, as was the case with the Downfall.</p>
			<p>Next, I think we will consider the plot, and then we will supplement it with gameplay that has not been told before.</p>

		<img id="sprt" src="">
		<h2>The plot</h2>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>The game still starts with a <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/ScreenShot0001.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot0" data-caption="Катсцена зачаровывания Маски Морали">cutscene</a> of the ritual of enchanting the Mask of Moral, only the Etheran should be made normal, otherwise this one looks more like a hologram from the Essence.</p>
			<p>After putting on the mask, the player again finds himself in Ashrain, but there will yet be no <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/ScreenShot0002.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot0" data-caption="Эшрейн без каменных ворот">stone gates</a> in it, because Risryn has not yet betrayed Guides. And build a system of gradual weeding out of the weak, preventing Prospects from passing further, just blocking the path with these gates. <i>I talked in more detail in the last series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITNdzIooyf8" target="_blank">Absolver the Analysis of the Universe</a>, there are of course a few errors, but in general they are not so significant.</i> Also, since there are no Lost Prospects in Ashrain, it is worth making the opponents neutral and in order to fight them you need to challenge them to battle. To do this, simply take an NPC in a target and use one of the animations that are used for greetings in 1v1 among the players. After that, the NPC will bow back and start the fight. If the player dies, then he will raise you, and if he dies, the player will be able to raise him. Well, this is not necessary, just his mask will appear. And if you attack him without a challenge to battle, then he and other Prospects standing nearby will attack in response. Naturally, it is worth leaving a couple of aggressive Prospects who will attack you as soon as they see. <i>(Well, like scumbags)</i></p>
			<p>As for training, I think it's worth shifting a part to Risryn, and tell here only: How to take the enemy on target and change it, how to attack, change stances, hold the block, dodge, use style ability, run and how to challenge the enemy to fight. Moreover, the last is the only thing to do, so to speak, lore. That is, the player will meet the Prospect, who will tell him about etiquette, and what is necessary before the battle, bow to the enemy.</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
				After passing the location of Ashrain, the player will come to <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/ScreenShot0003.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Раслан">Raslan</a>, I think it will also be possible to meet ordinary Prospects here, but of course there will be more Losts. According to the story, the player will have to undergo training from Risryn and become stronger, that is, get 10 level of Combat Trials in order to fight the Examiner <i>(I hope you will come up with a name for him)</i> and become an Absolver. After receiving this objective from Guide on Guidance Bridge, the player will head to Risryn in the Hanging Gardens of Adal. Since the stone gates have not yet been installed, and no one needs to be filtered at all, it is also possible to make several paths to Imperial Quarters. But let's leave only 1 way to the hanging gardens, through the Library. For there now absolutely by chance, there will be Kuretz. Well, it turns out we will have two ways to get to the upper floors of the library:
				<ul>
					<li>1 After passing through <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/ScreenShot0004.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Золотые ворота ведущие к первому этажу Императорской библиотеки">the golden gate</a>, into the library and climb to the very top</li>
					<li>2 Climb <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/ScreenShot0005.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Имперские казармы">the walls of Raslan</a>, and enter through the entrance on the penultimate floor. <i>(the one through which we walk now)</i></li>
				</ul>
			<p>Upon approaching the stairs to the last floor, a <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Scene1.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Катсцена встречи с Куретцем 1">cutscene</a> will begin: It will be modular, and will depend on the number of players in the group. If the player is 1, then he meets 2 NPCs, they invite him to the group, he agrees. If there are 2 players, then they meet 1 NPC and invite him to the group. And if there are 3 players, then they don't meet anyone. And the three of them go up to the last floor of the library. There they meet <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Scene2.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Катсцена встречи с Куретцем 2">Kuretz</a>, he, noticing the newcomers, begins to destroy their minds. However, players due to this process fall through the railing to the very <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/ScreenShot0006.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Первый этаж Императорской библиотеки">first floor</a>. And then they are reborn near the Altar there. <i>(Yes, on the first floor of the Tower of Adal, you will need to install the Altar)</i> From this moment, the PVE mode itself begins, where players will have to climb back to the top floor, fighting with the misguided pretenders and defeat Kuretz. It will adapt to the number of players, and if you fight 1v1, then it will be just a fair fight, if 2v1, it will sometimes stun a random player for a few seconds <i>(well, the character will supposedly lose consciousness)</i>, and if 3v1, then in addition to stunning, he will sometimes also take one of the players under his control <i>(the player will not be able to control the character, and AI will act for him)</i>. And yes, these abilities are needed so that with a larger number of players it would still be interesting to play with him, however, from a lore point of view, I too thought of everything.</p>
			<div id="lore">
				<p>I have a theory that I haven't published yet. And according to her Gleams are similar in structure to the brain. They have segments where, like neurons, information is stored. Thanks to what Etherans can exist - they consist of Gleams, and one can say they are completely composed of a crystal brain. This explains both their immortality and ability to respawn, because even if all the energy from Gleam is removed, when it is restored, the Ether will be fully functional again. Also, due to this, Etherans are able to copy themselves in whole or in part into other crystals of Gleams. This explains the appearance of Arcell's clones and how exactly he controlled the Lost in the first part. Since they copy neurons in structure, by placing them in the nervous system of living beings, Etherans will be able to control the "captured areas". <i>(For example, if we replace the neurons in the cervical spinal cord with Gleams, then not passing and creating impulses to the necessary muscles, it will be possible to control the person completely, with the exception of the muscles that are on the head.)</i></p>
				<p>As for Kuretz, he most likely opens portals to the rift inside the brain and the Etheran on the other side of the portal <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Lore1.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Процесс разрушения рассудка Претендентов">places a piece of Gleam in the right area of the brain</a>  and tries in every possible way to drive Prospect crazy and instill that he should bow down and protect the Essence. If the Prospect withstands this suggestion for a few seconds, then Kuretz opens the portal again and the Ether takes back this piece, and if not, then the Ether leaves it and continues to control the Prospect's.</p>
			</div>
			<p>After defeating Kuretz, the player finally travels to Risryn for training. After meeting with her, a cutscene will begin where Risryn will explain to the player that the training will last 3 days, then she will show him his room for the duration of the training, and then they will return to the arena and begin the first lesson. Each lesson is a regular battle, where in addition to winning, you need to complete another task.</p>
			<p>In the first lesson, Risryn will teach the player a basic combat tactic - Sitting in a block while waiting to use a Style Ability. Well, here it will be necessary to do something so that the player has to use Style Ability several times and defeat Risryn.</p>
			<p>And at the end, a <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Scene5.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Первая катсцена с Рисрин">cutscene</a> will begin: At night, the player was additionally training and, noticing this, Risryn told him to go to sleep, because even though the Mask of Moral allows you to do without food and sleep. There were cases when Absolvers did not sleep for a long time, their reaction worsened and even began to forget more.</p>
			<p>After that, the player will appear in their room, and will be able to continue training by finding Risryn. In the second lesson, she will teach you how to use feints. Here, as it were, it's clear, you use feints several times during the battle and defeat her.</p>
			<p>And then another cutscene where the player will talk to Risryn, from which he learns that she is studying the reasons for the appearance of Lost Prospect.</p>
			<p>The player will then reappear in their room, and will be able to complete the tutorial by finding Risryn. In the third lesson there will be several fights, first she will talk about how to learn techniques, and the player will have to learn a couple of techniques before defeating her <i>(you can make it so that during this battle the player gets more learning points of attacks for blocking and using Ability)</i>. Then she will ask you to make a new deck. After doing it, there will be another battle, and if the player loses, he will be able to change the deck. At the end, she will talk about the properties of equipment, characteristics and how they affect the battle.</p>
			<p>At the end of the explanation, the last <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Scene6.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot1" data-caption="Финальная катсцена обучения у Рисрин">cutscene</a> will begin: In the morning, the next day, the player goes to Risryn's room. She will be standing by a table littered with various books, scrolls, and a pair of Lost Prospect Masks. The player will then tell Risryn about meeting Kuretz. Then Risryn staggered and leaned on the table, asking him to leave. The player will try to object, but she will raise her voice and ask to be left alone. Then player says goodbye and leaves.</p>
			<p>The player will spawn at the door to Risryn's room and will now need to reach level 10 in the Combat Trials. If he arrives early, the Examiner will simply say that the player is too weak and he is not going to waste time on him. And when the player completes the training and reaches level 10 in CT, he will be able to start the battle when he comes to the Examiner. This boss should use Shadow Avoid and Exhaust. Moreover, he should use Shadow Avoid quite often, approximately like Corrupted Scholar Guide from the first part. <i>(just don't do new moves with Shadow Avoid)</i> After the victory, the player initiation into Absolvers and returned to Raslan.</p>
			<p>There will also be places in Raslan where Absolvers will sometimes spawn. There are 10 of them in total, and at first the player will come across only 5 Absolvers, but after defeating each of them, the spawn of 5 more Absolvers will be unlocked. <i>(That is, all 10 will spawn already)</i> From everyone you can get a Shard the first five will be get Earthquake, Shield, Exhaust, Gravity and Shockwave, and the second one: Silence, Sharp Impact, Snatcher, Unbreakable and Shadow Avoid. Having met such an Absolver, the player can talk to him, after which, if he has not yet been defeated, he will tell you how to use this fragment <i>(examples can be taken from the previous idea)</i>, and then temporarily give the player this Power to fight, and invite him to practice. In order for this Power to remain, it is necessary that the player uses it a couple of times and defeats Absolver.</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
		After reaching level 30 in the Combat Trials <i>(thus I decided to show that the player spent some time in Raslan before they were given the task)</i>, when they enter the open world, the player will be called to Towerpoint in order to send him to the next task. <i>(Here you can just play a small event where Guide will report information through the mask as Iktar did)</i> A Guide will appear at Towerpoint, after talking with him, the player will find out about his new task: Set off with a detachment of 15 Absolvers to Lake Ripa and capture the old Adalian fortress in which the Robbers settled, blocking the trade routes between Orate and Uring<br>
		<i>(At Towerpoint there will be a map of the world, and it will be possible to go to other locations, and after receiving this task, the map will have the opportunity not only to return to Raslan, but also to go to <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Fortress_ConceptEN.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot2" data-caption="Концепт Крепости">the Fortress in Lake Ripa</a>. By the way, regarding how to get to Towerpoint, I think that you can under minimap in the Altar to add a sign of Towerpoint by clicking on which you can teleport to Towerpoint)</i>
			<p>Having gone to Lake Ripa, the player will appear in a small camp in the center of which there is a <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/ConceptAltarEN.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot2" data-caption="Концепт Переносного Алтаря">Portable Altar</a>, the Essence is placed inside it, so that, when unfold, it is possible to restore energy in the Mask.</p>
			<div id="lore">
				<p>And yes, according to my theory, the Mask of Moral does not revive after death, but simply instantly heals all wounds, spending the energy of the Essence on it <i>(approximately like Shards)</i>. And when it ends, the Mask with wearer fold and unfold at the Altar to restore energy. The Altar itself is made in such a way that it is connected with the Essence in the mines and takes energy from them.</p>
			</div>
			<p>It will be impossible to fight in this location, there will be 12 NPCs in total, and in fact it is needed only for the plot.</p>
			<p>
				In order to start the mission, you need to talk to Absolver who is in the tent, but he will tell you how the capture will take place:
				First, one of the side towers is captured in order to break through it to the tower near the gate. After that, you need to get to the mechanism that lowers the gate, and disable it with a Shard of Silence. <i>(This mechanism works on the Essence)</i><br>
				Then you should clear the entire fortress, first the courtyard, then the Donjon itself.
			</p>
			<p>After that, a cutscene will begin, where all Absolvers gather and go to the fortress. Then, when they have already approached, the sentries notice them and raise the alarm.</p>
			<p>Now the players need to get to the points, and activate them in order for the ladder to appear <i>(they use Shards to unfold the ladder)</i>. Then you need to get into the tower and clear it, making your way to the gate. The mechanism that lowers the gate can be turned off by the players themselves if there is a power of Silence, but also one NPC will have such a Shard, and if the players do not have Silence, then they will have to lead it to the mechanism.</p>
			<p>After disabling the mechanism, a cutscene will begin, where the gate opens and all the robbers retreat into the courtyard, and all Absolvers also go out into the courtyard of the fortress.</p>
			<p>Now there will be a simple fight with a bunch of opponents where players with other Absolvers make their way through the courtyard of the fortress to the Donjon.</p>
			<p>As for the opponents, then - all the robbers are ordinary people who do not have Masks of Moral, because of which they should have a small amount of HP, and increased damage received from cutting attacks. <i>(In fact, from the sword they should die in 1-2 hits)</i><br>
			However, some have heavy armor that absorbs 90% of damage and grants level 2 resilience. <i>(It should not completely cover the body. For now it is unlikely that they have managed to invent full plate armor)</i> However, when dealing damage, the armor gradually breaks. In addition, she is vulnerable to weapons with bludgeoning damage and piercing attacks with slashing damage.</p>
			<p>And having risen to the 3rd floor, another cutscene begins - where Absolvers get to the room of the ataman of the robbers, and going inside, he tries to resist, but quickly gives up.</p>
			<p>By the way, in this mode, the number of respawns is limited, and if everyone dies before they get to the boss, then the mission will fail.</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>The scene of Absolvers returning to the Towerpoint is then shown, and the player is told that his are being assigned to tour of duty in Newforest. After that, he teleports to a village located <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Position_Newforest_Village.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot3" data-caption="Область где может распологаться деревня">near the southeastern border with the Tear</a>.</p>
			<p><a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Village.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot3" data-caption="Концепт деревни">A fenced part of the village</a> will be available for free movement. It will be full of villagers doing their jobs, as well as a few Absolvers who roam the area. They can be challenged to a duel, but the battles will not be lethal, only up to half HP. And in the center of the village there will also be a Portable Altar.</p>
			<p>Then, by good fortune for the players, the village will be attacked. And in order to unlock this event, you need level 40 of Combat Trials.</p>
			<p>By launching it through the altar <i>(I don't know how to optimally integrate it into the plot, so it will simply be available from the menu. There was an idea to make the event start after you challenge the NPC to fight after reaching level 40, but not everyone will fight with NPCs + even fewer players will start the battle in a group)</i> a cutscene will begin, where Absolvers, including the players, fight each other to kill time. However, their entertainment is interrupted by fleeing workers. Absolvers immediately head for the gate and see an advancing army of Tear, some of which have already run outside the village walls.</p>
			<p>At this stage, players need to kill all opponents breaking through the gate. After that, the gates will close and the players will have to fight off waves of opponents for some time.</p>
			<p>Then the next cutscene will begin, an explosion is heard and the players go to the place of the explosion to protect the settlement. Upon arrival, players will notice pieces of wood and earth scattered due to the explosion of the wall, <i>(I thought a lot about what kind of <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Wall_ConceptEN.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot3" data-caption="Концепт стен деревни">walls the village</a> should have ... At all, it's worth talking separately about how sieges could be held in this world. But for now, just I will say that the best option for this village would be to create two wooden walls between which there is earth.Although in reality it is not so easy to set fire to wood, with the Essence it can be done much easier, so that the earth will reduce the risk of fire, because it will prevent air from entering from the back side , and also helps to moisten the wood.Also, the earth will well extinguish kinetic energy, so that such walls will be more effective against shells and explosions)</i>as well as several scouts robbing and setting fire to buildings.</p>
			<p>Now the players will have a task - to protect the workers, and not to let the Tearans escape with the loot. And the better they defend the settlement, the greater the reward they will receive. <i>(Guides will reward them for protecting the village, I think you can pour some Essence and raise the level of donations to get a couple more Rift Coins)</i></p>
			<p>Well, after completing this task, a cutscene will begin, where the Tearans retreat (possibly with the loot), and Absolvers go to help the workers.</p>
			Regarding opponents:
				<ul>
					<li>Most of the Tearans are ordinary people with heavy armor.</li>
					<li>But some use a spell similar to the Mask of Moral spell, which will cause them to have a normal amount of HP and they will not die. <i>(There should be few of them, and from a lore point of view - this attack was testing a new technology that mimics the Masks of Moral, as well as an attempt to get resources and provisions)
					<br>(also, to them can give less HP than Absolvers and Prospects, because their technologies are most likely not as high quality as compared to Guides technologies)</i></li>
				</ul>
			<p>By the way, in this mode, the number of revivals is also limited, and if everyone dies before they kill all the Tearans, then the mission will fail.</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>Further, in order to return to Raslan, the player will have to get level 60 in CT. <i>(Did you know that Newforest is one of the most boring places in all of Ilentia?)) )</i> Having received it, Guides will order the player to return to Raslan to complete a new task. <i>(Again we use the voice message when entering the open world)</i></p>
			<p>In Raslan, on Guidance Bridge, there will be a Guide, talking to him will start a cutscene. <i>(Yes, we start the last plot arc right from the PVE mode)</i> In it, Guide will tell you that Risryn betrayed Guides and kills everyone in a row, and that a detachment of Absolvers is fighting with her at the wooden bridge, and the player with 2 other Absolvers <i>( If player 1, then 2 NPCs will be introduced to him, if the 2nd, then 1, and if there are already 3 players in the group... well you understand)</i> needs to come to the rescue. And also that when they finish it is necessary to come to Towerpoint and report to him. The cutscene then continues as the player's squad arrives at Risryn. She is already finishing off the last Absolver without the Mask, and noticing the help she turns to them.</p>
			<h4><i>And now let's digress a little on Risryn's AI:</i></h4>
			<p>Risryn will need to change the AI so that she can fight on equal terms against multiple opponents.</p>
			<p>First you need to give her the opportunity to use Abilities of Forsaken and Windfall at any time. That is she no longer needs to lose a quarter of her hp to change her style. <i>(you can add a style that from time to time changes the stance of Windfall and Forsaken , leave dodges on the mouse, and do the parry as in Sifu - on pressing Shift, and when it is held down, Risryn will go into block)</i></p>
			<p>Also now, when using style skills, she must take into account all attacks directed in her direction, and choose those skills with which it will be possible to defend herself from all blows. And for this, she must also be able to use several skills in a row. <i>(and all skills must be "successful" so that you can skip recovery frames, and dodge and / or parry at the same time in different directions)</i></p>
			<h4><i>We return to the 4th PVE mode:</i></h4>
			<p>The battle with Risryn begins, and when she loses half her HP, a cutscene will begin where, after the next parry of all attacks, the squad will retreat back to the bridge, and Risryn will draw a sword. After that, the battle will continue on it. And after losing some more small amount of HP, a cutscene will begin, where the player <i>(if there are several players, then for each it will be shown from his face)</i>, jumping away from the blow, he will land on a rotten board, due to which a piece of the bridge will fall through with the player.</p>
			<p>After that, he revived at the nearest Altar. And the player will need to go to Towerpoint to further progress through the plot.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Talking to Guide at Towerpoint, a cutscene starts. The player with Guides and a few more Absolvers gather around the table. And Guides begin to tell the plan to kill Risryn  - the Player will have to fight her while the others chant a spell that should disenchant her Mask of Moral, preventing her from interrupting her singing.</p>
			<p>Then the cutscene goes to the moment where the player with 9 Absolvers enter the Hanging Gardens of Adal, then Risryn is shown, who is standing in the "arena", after which 9 Absolvers surround her <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Scene3.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot4" data-caption="Катсцена перед финальным боем с Рисрин">lined up against the walls</a>.</p>
			<p>And the player also approaches her and challenges her to a duel by bowing and stand in a combat stance. Then there will be a regular battle under the choir of Absolvers. <i>(I think it will look pretty epic)</i></p>
			<p>After Risryn loses half her HP, the next cutscene will begin, where she, realizing that they are trying to remove the enchantment from her mask with this incantation, will abruptly turn around and head towards one of Absolvers-Callers. The player will try to stop her, but she will have time to kill this Absolver. After that, the other Absolvers will attack her. She draws her sword and quickly kills them. Then decides to return to the player.</p>
			<p>Now in the fight, Risryn will start talking to the player, she will invite them to join her and will talk about the various bad deeds of Guides.</p>
			<p>And after she says all the lines, the last cutscene <i>(yes, in fact, you just need to hold out, and in order to kill her it was impossible, you can increase the damage resistance)</i> will begin, where the player will refuse her offer, saying in response. "That despite everything she listed, Guides are the only ones who can help anyone affected by Downfall right now." <i>(Naturally they don't know that it was the Conduits that caused the Fall)</i> "And that if Guides disappear, then Absolvers will simply scatter, and no one will be able to control the Lost Prospect. Which can cause even more problems." Well, after that comes one of the endings. <i>(because I still haven't decided which is better)</i>The player either asks for a favor and leaves, or Risryn <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Scene4.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="plot4" data-caption="Катсцена убийства игрока">kills him</a>, and he also asks for a favor: "So that she doesn't kill anyone she deems worthy." <i>(and it will be the player from the first part)</i>Well, if the first ending is still chosen, then the cutscene will continue where after some time the player, in the role of one of Marked ones of the first part <i>(Marked in the cutscene will be selected based on the player's gender and skin color , so that it does not differ much from them)</i>, will hand over the fragment to Prospect, which will refer to the player from the first part.</p>

		<h2>Combat Trials</h2>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
		So now we need to understand the Combat Trials that have not been told:
			<ul id="long">
				<li>1v1 <i>(Available from the very beginning)</i> — In fact, it is no different from the first part. However, with the opening of a new arc, new locations for him will be available.</li>
				<li>3v3 <i>(Available from the very beginning)</i> — It is worth reworking this mode a bit from a lore point of view.
					Your task is to find and stabilize the portals in the Fold, after closing them. <i>(The points will be more like portals in the Fold, and in order for them to give points, you will have to not only capture them, but also have to sit on them until the point runs out. You can also add that when the character stands on the point and there are no opponents nearby, that he begins to sing a melody that stabilizes the portal.)</i><br>
					From each stabilized portal, you will be able to get some Essence. <i>(That is, the team that closes the point will receive some Essence.)</i></li>
				<li>
					CoopPVP2 <i>(unlocked after beating the plot in Lake Ripa)</i> - In this mode, Absolvers train to defend and capture fortresses. The capture process is identical to the story mission in Ripa.<br>
					This is a 6v6 team battle, the invaders need to be able to infiltrate the Fortress for a certain number of respawns, and from that moment on, the second squad will also have a limited number of respawns.<br>
					The team that brings the opponent's respawn counter to 0 wins.
				</li>
				<li>
					CoopPVP3 <i>(unlocked after beating the plot in Newforest)</i> - This mode is Essence convoy defense training for Portable Altars.
					The mode is quite simple - you need to kill all the members of the enemy team before at least one of them revives. Or wait until the wagons reach the village or fortress. <i>(Because Portable Altars are used both in villages and protected areas of Newforest, and in Strongholds in the unoccupied territories of the former Adal and the recently captured fortress in Ripa)</i> In this case, the team defending the convoy will win.
				</li>
				<li>
					CoopPVP4 <i>(unlocked after completing the plot)</i> - This mode is an addition to School Challenge. The whole point is to steal the Essence from another school. Between school challenges, the school mentor will be able to open the vault, where you need to put 30,000 fragments. <i>(moreover, it is impossible to put more)</i> The storage can be replenished only by those who will participate in the Tournament. <i>(the number of participants is not limited)</i> To participate, 3 conditions are required:
					<ol style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<li>Must be a school Disciple</li>
						<li>Disciple must have access to this mode <i>(that is, complete the entire game)</i></li>
						<li>Mentor must allow Disciple to participate in the Tournament</li>
					</ol>
					<p>When School Challenge begins, access to the storage is closed, and if they did not have time to put enough Essence, then it will simply return to their owners. And if the required amount is there, then they will be able to participate in battles 1 time per day.</p>
					<p>The mode itself is quite simple, there are containers with the Essence of 2 schools, they contain 6000 fragments each <i>(if the school has less than 6000 fragments left in the storage, then the container will contain all the Essence that they have)</i>. Players need to steal as much Essence as possible. It will be possible to take 300 fragments at a time, but they will reduce mobility by 10. After the time runs out, the winner will be the school that has more fragments in the container and its students. All stolen Essence will go to the School storage.</p>
					<p>And upon completion of School Challenge, the remaining fragments in the Vault will be distributed among all participants in relation to the number of participation in the tournament. <i>(Those who fought more in this mode will receive more shards than those who fought less)</i> The top schools in the tournament are compiled by the number of shards in storage.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the way, in the Combat Trials section, all open modes will be available, regardless of where you are.</p>
			
		<img id="sprt" src="">
		<h2>World</h2>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p><b>Well, at the end we will analyze everything else.</b></p>
			<p>To begin with, I believe that the world needs to be made bigger. Raslan is a huge city that has an extremely curious architecture, where buildings are essentially <a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/012/184/052/large/michel-donze-absolver-architectureguide-03.jpg" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="world" data-caption="">built on top of each other and connected by bridges</a>, forming a multi-level road system. However, in the game we see houses with a maximum of 3-4 floors. And in fact, what we saw in the concept art is found only in Tower of Adal area. Personally, I would really like to get into these multi-level labyrinths, where one could even expect some kind of Lost one to fall on top of you. And that's why I think it's worth making the locations bigger and higher.</p>
			<p>However, I understand that it is very difficult to make such a city 2 times larger, not to mention the scale of 1 to 1. And therefore, I think it is worth making Raslan larger, but at the same time reducing the accessible part for movement, the location area will not become much larger. <i>(although they will grow a lot in volume)</i> And the rest parts of the city can be made less detailed, and very distant parts can be generally 2D sprites. I really liked this implementation in Sifu, because it is very suitable and at the same time emphasizes the visual style of the game — combination of low poly and painterly styles.</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
		I would also like to talk a little about the ambience of Raslan in general, and to reveal to them a little the life of Absolvers. In general, Raslan should be a little scary and gloomy. How would it the ruins of the city, which are filled with crazed Lost Prospects ready to kill you for the sake of the Essence. But there must be two much busier places in Raslan:
			<ol>
				<li><p>Guidance Bridge — it is a peaceful place where newcomers come, and it is also where Prospects and Absolvers meet to unite and go explore Raslan. Fighting is not supposed to be accepted here, and everyone usually just relaxes in a pleasant, calm environment. <i>(Just add a few Prospects and Absolvers who sit somewhere)</i></p>
				<p>Also here you can put a small Temple where Guides live. True, it would be better if these were not simple Guides, but Guides-witnesses, they sometimes become Prospects, and some may put on Masks in order to carry Anlek's teachings among Absolvers. Plus when the player in the story needs to talk to Guide in Raslan, he will be one of those who are in this temple. You can also come to them, listen to their sermons, can also set up a donation box, which will act as an immersive way to make donations to Guides.</p></li>
				<li>Raslan Coliseum — here it is worth looking at the location from the point of view of lore. Absolvers were normal people, so I guess it would be okay if they wanted to get a place to sleep and rest again. And since Absolvers literally live in battles, there is no better place where they can live, except for the Colosseum. There are two things to show here:
					<ol id="long">
						<li>The fact that they tried to settle in: they cleaned the arena of debris so that more people could fight, cleared some littered passages, repaired the stands, etc. <i>(It needs to be shown that Absolvers are watching this place and don't want it to fall apart.)</i></li>
						<li>And the fact that Absolvers and Prospects live here. In the underground parts of the Colosseum there will be rooms where Absolvers can rest and sleep.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Well, regarding the ambience, the arena must constantly fight, and Absolvers will sit in the stands watching these battles. But inside the Colosseum, the ambience should be more like a tavern, people are discussing the latest sorties for the Essence, Absolvers are giving advice to the arrived Prospects, and in the underground parts, the Absolvers and Prospects are just relaxing with a calm ambience, where you can hear a little noise from above.</p>
					<p>It is also worth noting that if you challenge someone to a fight, then you will need to enter the arena to fight. <i>(all for the sake of preserving the ambience)))</i></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			It is also worth making a dynamic change in the time of day. This adds to the atmosphere and eliminates the problem of a star that manages to go almost <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Maps_of_Raslan_Star.jpg" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="world" data-caption="Положение звезды во всех областях, из одной точки">360° across the horizon</a>. By the way, for this I have prepared a small project in Blender, where you can rotate the planet, adjust its tilt, and see what position the star from Raslan will be in.
				<ul>
					<li>For <b>axis</b> in <b>Y</b> - adjust the tilt of the planet, in <b>Z</b> - you can rotate the planet along with the axis, simulating the position of the planet at different times of the year.</li>
					<li>For <b>Planet</b> in <b>Z</b> - you can rotate the planet simulating the time of day.</li>
					<li>I also tied the camera to the supposed location of Raslan, so that you can see in which part of the sky the star will be. I recommend using <b>Walk Navigation</b> for easier viewing of the sky from the surface of Ilentia.</li>
				</ul>

			<img id="sprt" src="">
				<p>At all, what problems do you have with the star, because in addition to the incomprehensible orbit of the planet around it, apparently it is also too close. I took screenshots of the star from all locations, and if this planet were in the solar system, then it would be closer to the Sun <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Star_Size.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="world" data-caption="Примерное сопоставление размера звезды с Илентии, и разремов Солнца с поверхности планет Солнечной системы">than Mercury</a>… <i>(I found a picture on the Russian wiki about <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Солнце#/media/Файл:Comparison_sun_seen_from_planets_ru.svg" target="_blank">the Sun</a> that showed in the ratio the size of the Sun observed from the surface planets of the solar system)</i> Yes, closer than the closest planet to the sun. Here, as it were, not only questions about the existence of life, but rather questions about the possibility of forming a planet at such a distance, appear. <i>(Of course, I was based on the size of my photo of the moon, and in general, all measurements are approximate, but I think this is not very critical, I do not think that the error will exceed 20%)</i>
				<br>So yes... when you do the second part <b>Be sure to make the star smaller!</b> Although personally I wouldn't do it just like the earth, but would do something in between Mercury and Venus, because I came up with a good scientific justification for the work of the Essence, which explains how the Essence works, where it takes energy from, and why there is water on the planet in liquid state and life.</p>
				<div id="lore">
					<p>Inside the crystals of the Essence there are small voids with a vacuum, from which the Essence takes Energy, which it then transforms into elementary particles. <i>(No, I'm not delusional, I was just based on the Inflationary Model of the Universe, where it was said that the energy to form our universe came from a vacuum, here is <a href="https://youtu.be/U6lyngQ_XE4?t=702" target="_blank">the video</a> on which I based it)</i> However, she cannot constantly take energy from a vacuum because of which she has to take it back from the surrounding world.
					<br>In a calm state <i>(until external forces spend its energy)</i>, it absorbs photons of the Infrared range <i>(i.e. heat)</i>, and immediately <i>(because he the vacuum "debt" nothing)</i> emits photons of the Ultraviolet range.
					<br>But when the Essence has already spent energy, it will not emit ultraviolet until it restores its "debt".</p>
					As proof of the ultraviolet radiation of a raw Essence, it is indirectly stated in the equipment of the Essence Miner:
					<ul>
						<li>The gloves say that when working with a raw Essence, you should protect yourself to wear protective layers.</li>
						<li>And the boots say that they faded from the light of the Essence.</li>
						<li>Also, a completely covered miner's outfit may tell us that contacting a raw Essence with open skin may not be the best idea.</li>
					</ul>
				<p style="margin-top: -12px;">Well, ultraviolet radiation is most suitable for this.</p>
				Accordingly, in this way it is possible to explain how the Essence receives Energy, as well as how spells work in general:
					<ul>
						<li>Under the influence of sound vibrations, the Essence recognizes them as instructions for the formation of certain elementary particles and possibly their unification.</li>
						<li>And regarding the proximity of the planet to the star, it is explained by the fact that the Essence cools the planet by taking energy for its transformations.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>And yes, many will notice that everything somehow lines up very conveniently, however, I just found a logical and scientific explanation for my observations.</p>
			</div>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>By the way, continuing to improve the ambience of the game, you can add weather phenomena. Let it rain at the host at any time, and everyone who connected to it will also start to rain. <i>(the main thing is that it starts gradually and not abruptly, although this also happens)</i> Then after a while it will end. And of course, you can add several types of rain: weak, normal, downpour, thunderstorm. And in snowy locations <i>(Top of the Tower, winter versions of locations for 1v1)</i> add snowfall and snowstorm.</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>
				Now the changes to the Altars:
				<br>For treatment, you do not need to sit down at the Altar, just walk up to it, and HP will gradually begin to recover. But you still have to sit down at the Portable Altars. <i>(As I said, this works because Altars take energy from Essence veins in the Raslan Mine, and release it in the form of energy that the Mask Essence can absorb.)</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, now players will only respawn at the nearest "open" Altars. <i>(This is much more logical, and it will be more convenient for many people when they accidentally died before they had time or forgot to sit down at the Altar. And yes, in this way, <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/Stones_of_Saved.jpg" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="world" data-caption="">"Stones of Saved"</a> are also no longer needed)</i>
				<br>And in order to make it more convenient to move around the already larger Raslan, it is worth giving the opportunity to teleport from one Altar to another, naturally open. For example, for this it will be enough to click on the desired <a href="../../../Images/Absolver/Absolver2/map.png" class="js-img-viewer" data-group="world" data-caption="">Altar icon on the map</a> on the left.
			</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>
				It's time to talk about the Donation System:
				<br>Instead of a shop and gived Rift coins, it is better to create a donation system. Where the player will donate the Essence to Guides, and by donating a certain amount <i>(for example, for every 300 fragments)</i> he will receive a Rift coin. It will also be possible to add a reward with some specific item <i>(for example, donate 9000 fragments and you will receive Absolver Captain Tunic)</i>.
				<br>You can also make it so that the level of BI will also affect the favor Guides, so to speak, and raise the level a little.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such a system, from a lore point of view, will be much more plausible, and with it the system of Guides for extracting the Essence will be much more clearly visible: Where the Lost Prospects, under the influence of Etherans, begin to constantly try to get the Essence. The Absolvers then stumble upon them, fight and take their Essence. And then they send it to the Guides in exchange for a reward.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, it is important to emphasize that it will be much easier to receive rewards with the help of donations than with the achievements of Absolver, in order to clearly show exactly how the Conduits receive the Essence. (roughly speaking, this system is another system of levels (Damn, how many of them are already in Abz?) where you need to get 300 points for each level, one point = 1 fragment of the Essence or several (let's say 5) CT levels)
				<br>(And yes, this is not really a donation system, but rather something like your influence/value for the Guides)</i>
			</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>
				It is also worth adding equipment wear, that is, after receiving a certain amount of damage, the equipped items of equipment will become "Unknown". <i>(You will need to set a fairly high value so that you don't have to constantly repair them)
				</i> It is also important that cloth, wool and leather equipment break much faster from cutting damage, but break more slowly from impact damage. And metal, on the cutting damage, almost did not break from cutting, but was vulnerable to impact damage.
				<br>Also, if the equipment breaks a second time, it will remain, but it will not be possible to wear it until it is repaired into a broken version. And then you can finish it up to the whole version.
			</p>
			<p>This will be useful as it will increase the spending of Fragments for players, and they will not accumulate millions (at least as quickly as now), especially when everything is open.</p>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>And finally, in order for everyone to pass the game, it's worth adding difficulty levels, they will only affect the AI level of the NPC, so it won’t affect the balance in PVP in any way.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<img id="sprt" src="">
			<p>In general, that's all I came up with for Absolver 2, as I said, I didn't touch on what I'm not going to change, and I also tried not to delve too deeply into lore. And then there would be even more text.</p>
			Though, I'll try to answer some questions:
			<ol id="long">
				<li>
					<p>
						Regarding the open world, yes, some have already asked me why I don't propose to make an open world game so that you can safely run around all of Ilentia. Well, if SloClap really starts making Absolver 2 in the open world, then don't be surprised when it takes 10 years more time to develop, and moreover, there will be even smaller Raslan than now.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Also, in my opinion, it is still worth leaving the possibility of playing it offline in the game. That is why I did not say anything about it, and also said that the previous concept is fully included in this one. Although the only mode in which you can't shove NPCs is the Tournament of Schools. I don't think I need to explain why.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>As for that plan to disappoint the Mask of Risryn, it's just an attempt to explain why Risryn is locked up in the Hanging Gardens and still hasn't escaped from there.
					<br>That is, the original plan was to disappoint Mask Risryn, and then kill her. However, she interrupted the spell before it fully worked, but it still managed to spoil the work of the mask and now this mask is "tied" to the Altar in the Hanging Gardens, and if Risryn dies, he will be reborn not at the nearest Altar, but at the Altar in the Hanging Gardens.</p>
					<p>When Guides found out about this, they quickly decided to block all passages to the Hanging Gardens. And leave only one, closing it with stone gates. Thus eliminating the possibility of Risrin meeting with the Lost Prospects. They also set up similar gates in Ashrain, in order to let only strong Prospects into Raslan.
					<br>And in Raslan itself, training was transferred to 6 Absolvers <i>(Markeds)</i>. And they also made it mandatory to pass the test with Kuretz, so that potential Lost Prospects would not die when they met Risryn. After all, along with this, they also significantly raised the bar for becoming an Absolver. Now, in order to become an Absolver, you need to defeat, though former, but still one of the strongest Absolvers. In this way, they were going to hasten the assassination of Risryn, and prevent the possible spread of opposition among Absolvers. After all, the more Absolvers who are able to fight Risrin at least on an equal footing, the more likely it is that she will die at their hands.</p>
