<h1>What&#8217;s next</h1>

<p>This is just the first great milestone for us with Absolver. We&#8217;ll be adding new features and assets to the game on a regular basis, so be sure to come back and check in regularly! Right now we&#8217;ve planned our next few releases already, and our focus is on bringing the features that you&#8217;ve asked for the most :</p>

<h2>Private Matches </h2>

<p>Private 1v1 matches will be added soon to allow you to play the 1v1 Combat Trial against a specific friend, instead of being matched with all players in your region.</p>

<h2>3v3 Game Mode</h2>

<p>We have already started working on a 3v3 Combat Trial, in which two teams of players will fight for victory. The mode is really fun to play already, but it still needs some debugging and polish so we decided to release it a few weeks after launch. Stay tuned for intense team melee action !</p>

<h2>Spectator mode</h2>

<p>While we were in beta we&#8217;ve been lucky enough to witness some of the intensity that Absolver will bring to players. So that everyone can join in on the fun, we&#8217;ll be adding a Spectator mode to the game so you can get inspired by other players and their own mastery of the game&#8217;s mechanics.</p>

<h1>New website</h1>

<p>As you may have already noticed, we&#8217;re launching this news article on a new website that we&#8217;ve designed to keep all players informed about what&#8217;s going on with the game. We&#8217;ve included forums where you can start discussing mechanics, strategies, insights, and also find other like-minded players. <a href="https://www.absolvergame.com/forums/" title="Absolver Forums">Head here</a> to enter the community!</p>
