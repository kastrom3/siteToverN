      <span class="news-article__date font-title">November 5, 2018</span>
      <div class="news-article__body"><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>We’ve been working since the Downfall release to identify and fix the bugs reported with this new version.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this patch was delayed until now to allow us to address the complicated save issues that appeared earlier this month.</p>

<p>We’re still trying to find and fix more bugs, and if you have any video illustrating an issue, do not hesitate to send it at support_pc@sloclap.com or support_ps4@sloclap.com</p>

<p>The team is currently fully focused on the Xbox version and a part of the programming team is also dedicated to more debug (including combat).</p>

<p>Please find the details of this patch below:</p>

<h1>Combat</h1>

<ul>
	<li>UI &#8211; Fixed discrepancy between the Attack Stats in the Attack details menu</li>
</ul>

<h1>School</h1>

<p>We added a rematch limit for 1v1s when in a School Challenge (5 matches limit). The UI prompt will be added in an upcoming patch!</p>

<ul>
	<li>UI &#8211; You can now View and Invite a player directly from the Leaderboard</li>
	<li>UI &#8211; Added Detail panels for School Gestion and School Challenges</li>
	<li>UI &#8211; Fixed a visual glitch on rematch in Combat Trial</li>
	<li>UI &#8211; You can now view the profile of the Top 3 players in your School</li>
	<li>UI &#8211; Added some popup prompts when leaving / joining a School</li>
	<li>UI &#8211; Improved information displayed when clicking on another player in the School</li>
	<li>UI &#8211; Fixed some Leaderboard issues where the details wouldn’t display after several swaps between leaderboards</li>
	<li>Fixed some issues with School XP</li>
	<li>Players cannot change their inventory in Combat Trials while participating in a School Challenge anymore</li>
</ul>

<h1>Downfall Mode</h1>

<ul>
	<li>UI &#8211; Fixed a bug where the depth selected didn’t fit with the details displayed in the right panel</li>
</ul>

<h1>Misc</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed some issues related to Coop in 1v1 and getting back to the Main Map
	<ul>
		<li>If you joined a friend and that your friend left, you’d be respawned at the start of the game instead of the last altar when dying</li>
		<li>If you relaunched a 1v1 Coop matchmaking while your friend was still loading, your group would be disbanded without notification</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Fixed various overlapping issues in the Menus and some specific languages</li>
	<li>Fixed various lighting issues in the game</li>
	<li>Fixed a color mismatch with the Shabu Guard Set</li>
</ul></div>
