      <div class="news-article__body"><p>Hi everyone! </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve just uploaded Absolver 1.11 on Steam, <span class="caps">GOG</span> and PS4. The team has been working very hard these past weeks on getting the 3v3 &#8220;Overtake&#8221; game mode ready for the Absolver community and we&#8217;re very happy to share it with you today. As you&#8217;ll notice, the Overtake game mode is still in beta, as we are still fixing some issues, but it is already really fun and we&#8217;ve been having a great time playtesting it at the studio! <br>
Other improvements in this update include 1v1 Private Games, a new Shop for equipment, weapons and emotes, full 21:9 monitor support, equipment color dye, as well as the ability to rematch directly from the post-match Combat Trial screen, both in 1v1 and 3v3. Complete release notes are below.</p>

<p>Absolver will be featured from today until Monday morning as the Steam Weekend Deal with a 50% off discount with the goal of inviting many new players into the ranks of Absolvers. We will need your help in getting the word out on this update, so if you enjoy the game and the recent updates, please share the news to friends: we need as many Prospects as possible on the plains of Adal! </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also been closely monitoring player feedback on forums and social media, although we haven&#8217;t had time to respond to all your requests and concerns. Sorry for not communicating a lot recently, but next week we will share with everyone more news on our roadmap, and the upcoming improvements that we are planning to implement to Absolver in future updates.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you for your continued support, and please let us know what you think about this new game mode!</p>

<p>All the best,<br>
Sloclap team</p>

<p>Disclaimer: There was an issue with the dye system, it will be up <span class="caps">ASAP</span>! We apologize for the inconvenience everyone!</p>
