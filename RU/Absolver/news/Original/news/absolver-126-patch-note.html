      </div>

      <span class="news-article__date font-title">October 11, 2018</span>
      <div class="news-article__body"><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>We’re really sorry about the Saves and gear disappearing issues that have been happening with the Downfall launch.</p>

<p>It appeared that older saves didn’t adapt as expected when updating straight to the latest save versions for the game, and it generated incompatibilities. We addressed these with the first and second patches post Downfall and issued a first wave of compensation for all PC and PS4 players. </p>

<p>We’re relieved to confirm that this 1.26 patch will fix the last equipment disappearing bug that still occured in specific conditions.<br>
We are aware that the previous compensation didn’t cover all lost gear issues, for example all unique loot lost, so you’ll find below the details for this second wave.</p>

<p>Every player that has lost unique loot (listed below) from cairns and pickups spots in the Main Map will find in their inventory all the loots from those caches including (depending on if they had it in their save before or not):<br>
<ul>
	<li>Silly Face Mask</li>
	<li>Lost Prospect Mask</li>
	<li>Folded Eyes Mask</li><br>
</ul></p>

<p>Every player that has lost unique loot (listed below) from the bosses in the Main Map will find in their inventory the missing unique loot (depending on if they had it in their save before or not):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Curved Sword</li>
	<li>Spike Turtle Wargloves</li>
	<li>Silan Mask</li>
	<li>Risryn Sword</li>
	<li>Risryn Overtop</li>
	<li>Absolver Cloak</li>
	<li>Cargal Shoulder</li>
	<li>Kuretz Shoulder</li>
	<li>Kuretz Overtop</li>
	<li>Kuretz Mask</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless, the game will also try to give back in players’ inventories the lost gear that it can find: Gear registered in presets, and gear currently equipped.<br>
We didn’t succeed in finding a way to retrieve 100% of lost gears in the saves, so if the game detects that you were affected by the bug, you’ll also find in your inventory 5 Rift Disks.</p></div>
