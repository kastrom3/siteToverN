      <span class="news-article__date font-title">October 4, 2018</span>
      <div class="news-article__body"><p>Hi everyone, </p>

<p>First of all, we need to apologize to the PC players who encountered Equipment disappearing issues on Friday night and Saturday. This issue was solved in the first hotfix this weekend, but we are unfortunately unable to give back to everyone the exact content lost, so we decided to award all PC and PS4 players 10k fragments and 10 crystals as compensation. You will find them added to your character when connecting after this patch. Sorry again to all players who have lost items and rewards recently. We’ve also been working on improving the Downfall experience this last week, you’ll find below all the details for this patch.</p>

<p>Please make sure your game is up to date to avoid this weekend&#8217;s bug</p>

<h2>One equipment bug is still occuring in specific conditions</h2>

<p><b>If, when buying and equipping a new gear, you notice it disappear from your equipment list: don&#8217;t unequip it and wait for the 1.26 patch!</b></p>

<p>We got reports and saves from players who lost all their equipment when coming back to the game after a long break. Those players will receive another compensation with the upcoming 1.26 patch we’re currently working on. Details will be communicated with the patch.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Save files compatibility conflict has been resolved</li>
